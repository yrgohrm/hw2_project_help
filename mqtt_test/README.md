# MQTT data receiver

NB! This is a little helper program for the course "Hårdvarunära programmering
2" at Yrgo. It does not make much sens outside of that course.

This is a simple program to validate the data sent to the MQTT broker. It should
work out of the box by simply installing the requirements `pip install -r
requirements.txt` and then running the program with `python main.py` from within
a venv.
